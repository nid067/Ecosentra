🌍 Ecosentra – Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting & Resolution System

Ecosentra is a civic-tech solution developed during the Smart India Hackathon (SIH). It enables citizens to report civic issues in their locality and ensures that the respective authorities can act quickly and transparently. Our goal is to build a bridge between people and administrators, making governance more efficient and accountable.

🚀 How It Works

Citizen Reporting: Users can report issues such as waste dumping, broken streetlights, potholes, or water leakage. Each complaint includes a description, location, and optional images.

Database Storage: All complaints are securely stored in Google Firestore in real-time.

Admin Dashboard: Administrators log in to view, assign, and track complaints from citizens.

Status Tracking: Users receive updates on the progress of their complaints, ensuring transparency.

Cross-Platform Access: Ecosentra works as a website and a mobile app (Flutter) for better accessibility.
